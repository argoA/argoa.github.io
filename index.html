        <p>I am currently a Network Engineer for a WISP in the midwest. I am versed in essential networking protocols, such as OSPF, BGP and MPLS. My journey into tech started as a 91B Wheeled Vehicle Mechanic in the U.S. Army. I transitioned to the civilian sector working my way up to where I am today. My primary goal is to continue to grow my knowledge in networking and use that towards a path in the Cyber Security sector.</p>
